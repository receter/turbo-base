# Features

Features are the main building blocks of the application. They represent features that are used in the application.

What is the difference between a feature and a container? A container is like a page and a feature might be used in several containers. A container is never used by a feature.

Features can depend on other features.

Components and containers group interface elements and features group functionality.

Can features provide components?
